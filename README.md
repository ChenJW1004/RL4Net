# RL4Net
RL4Net Simulator - A simulator of reinforcement learning algorithm research for networking

Implementing a reinforcement learning environment and algorithms for network from scratch is a difficult task. Inspired by the work of [ns3-gym](https://github.com/tkn-tub/ns3-gym), we developed RL4Net (Reinforcement Learning for Network) to facilitate the research and simulator of reinforcement learning for networking. 

Below Figure shows the architecture of RL4Net:



RL4Net are composed of two functional blocks:
